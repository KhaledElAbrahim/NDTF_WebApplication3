            <h5>VU20917 Apply the principles of psychology to modify canine behaviour</h5>
            <br />
            <p>During this unit of study, students will discover the principles of learning and conditioning as well as the application of these concepts in dog training. It requires students to identify how dogs think and what motivates their behaviour. With this knowledge in hand, students are able to select appropriate training techniques in order to maximise canine learning. The study of animal psychology and the application of proven scientific principles is the only truly humane and effective way of modifying a dog’s behaviour.</p>
            <br />
            <p>Areas of study include:</p>
            <br />
            <ul>
                <li>Psychology of behaviour</li>
                <li>Intelligence and learning</li>
                <li>Instrumental learning</li>
                <li>Pavlovian conditioning</li>
                <li>Socialisation and desensitization</li>
                <li>Counter Conditioning</li>
                <li>Factors effecting learning</li>
            </ul>
            <br />
            <h5>VU20918 Investigate and assess canine behaviour</h5>
            <br />
            <p>Regardless of whether we are training dogs in obedience or dealing with behavioural problems, it is critical that we assess a dog correctly in order to determine the most appropriate course of action. During this unit of study students will learn how to correctly investigate the behaviour and perform thorough behaviour and temperament assessments.</p>
            <p>Many trainers and handlers concentrate on performance without reflecting very much on the means of communication between person and dog. Students’ education in the area of canine communication, behaviour systems and instincts, will enable them to become a trainer / handler who is in tune with his or her dog.</p>
            <p>This unit also traces the evolution and development of dogs from their ancient ancestors through to our modern breeds. It details the relationship of wolves and their influence on the behaviour of domestic dogs.</p>
            <p>Areas of study include</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Assessing canine behaviour</li>
                <li>Sensory capacities of the dog</li>
                <li>Canine communication and body language</li>
                <li>Instinctive behaviour</li>
                <li>Critical periods of development</li>
                <li>Group and breed profiles</li>
                <li>Evolution of the dog</li>
            </ul>
            <br />
            <h5>VU20919 Conduct dog obedience training</h5>
            <br />
            <p>This unit teaches students the golden rules used by dog trainers, for teaching simple tasks, through to teaching complex behaviours. It gives them the necessary background to train dogs in a successful, safe and responsible manner.</p>
            <p>The NDTF does not teach one set method of training. We aim to give students the basic principles behind a variety teaching methods, the advantages and disadvantages for each, and students can then go on to apply their preferred training technique.</p>
            <p>This unit also contains a practical, ‘hands-on’ component of the course, covering the training of adult dogs and puppies in all facets of obedience. Students be educated in the use of a variety of different training equipment and will have the opportunity to work with numerous dogs of all breeds and ages. All training is conducted under the guidance and supervision of highly qualified and experienced trainers.</p>

            <h5>VU20920 Manage common canine behaviour problems</h5>
            <br />
            <p>Dogs exhibit a wide variety of undesirable behaviour ranging from the digging of holes and excessive barking, through to fear and unwanted aggression. This unit not only deals with solving these issues but also gives students an understanding of the underlying causes. As well as dealing with existing problems, this unit focuses on the education of dog owners, the promotion of responsible dog ownership and the raising of confident, balanced family pets.</p>
