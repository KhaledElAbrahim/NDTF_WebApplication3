            <p>During this unit of study, students will discover the principles of learning and conditioning as well as the application of these concepts in dog training. It requires students to identify how dogs think and what motivates their behaviour. With this knowledge in hand, students are able to select appropriate training techniques in order to maximise canine learning. The study of animal psychology and the application of proven scientific principles is the only truly humane and effective way of modifying a dog’s behaviour.</p>
